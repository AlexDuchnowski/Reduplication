1: end	We sat there, day and night, trading places, Beth and I, with Toph downstairs usually, Beth and I sitting, sleeping there, sometimes draped over her, waiting for the near-end, so we could gather and then wait for the END-end.
2: surprising	Interviewee:   Well, not SURPRISING-surprising.
3: people	Tim:   D'you mean a lot of PEOPLE-people, or a lot of women-people?
4: steve	B:  You know, STEVE-Steve. Fiona's new Steve.
5: friends	Bianca:   No, FRIENDS-friends -- real friends. That's -- that's huge. Maggie, it's better this way.
6: friends	So I would say that the president and Mr. DeLay are friends, but not FRIENDS-friends, if you will.
7: gun	Maybe with a trank-gun, but not a GUN-gun. I hate GUN-guns.
8: late	Will:   LATE-late? Why, why, why, why, why?
9: hat	Should I wear a HAT-hat?
10: shock	A:  No, SHOCK-shock. Real shock.

12: bitches	Shavoo:  Stop, man. I'm not talking about those kind of bitches. I'm talking about BITCHES-bitches.

14: drink	Harold:   It was a DRINK-drink.
15: doctor	Neighbour:  A DOCTOR-doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
16: prof	We had a guest prof, and a guy in the class was opening an e-mail attachment that cranked the volume up, and there's a sound attachment that yells out "Hey everyone, I'm looking at porno!" and the PROF-prof was just shaking his head in shame.
17: medium	Roz:   Hold on, Frasier. Cashmere for under 40 bucks? I'll take one in black. In medium. Wait, is that MEDIUM-medium or unrealistic-anorexic-model-medium?
18: final	The FINAL-final copy has to be done by August.
19: date	Jennifer:   No, I know. The last time, you were rescuing me, but this would be, like, a DATE-date.
20: evil	Angel:   Well, it was an evil thing in terms of that world. It just wasn't an EVIL-evil thing.
21: home	Daughter:  No. I'm going HOME-home. Dad's place. Happy now?
22: party	Kristen:   Honey, that's really sweet. But it's not really a PARTY-party. It's more of a small family get-together. So I think your friend might feel a little uncomfortable.
23: going	Dr. Brown:   He's not influencing anything. I'm not even really going. I mean, I'm going but I'm not GOING-going.
24: fans	There's a guy who collects fans. These are not sports fans but FANS-fans
25: smart	Brittany:   Oh, Kevvy, I only kissed Robert to get even with you for kissing Zoe, it didn't mean anything, and now I know you do love me and you really mean it when you say smart doesn't matter, although I think I'm smarter than you think I am, although I know I'm not smarter than the really SMART-smart people, so I forgive you! Kevvy? Kevvy?
26: bacon	B:  How do they know it's turkey bacon and not BACON-bacon?
27: nuts	Caroline:   I know, but I didn't think you meant NUTS-nuts. I thought you meant raisin nipple nuts. Oh my god, I mean, she was just so convincing! I feel like a fool!
28: red	A:   RED-red or tongue red?
29: again	Well, it won't happen AGAIN-again.
30: together	Yeah, 'cause they're all together. Like, TOGETHER-together. Um, the blonde girl, that's Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett, they're, like, a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal.
31: pin	No, I need a PIN-pin.
32: play	B:  If you're playing, it's like for PLAY-play. You know you ain't getting paid, right?
33: aggressive	Felicity:   You're right, it's AGGRESSIVE-aggressive.
34: beach	Alison:   "A BEACH-beach." Oh, wow.
35: truth	Rosanna:   TRUTH-truth, or convenient-in-the-moment truth?
36: language	B::  No, her LANGUAGE-language is telling her she's innocent.
37: cow	She wasn't a fancy cow, a Hereford or Black Angus or something, just a COW-cow.
38: die	Dickie:   Wait. She DIE-dies? I thought this was a happy movie.
39: jealous	Caroline:   Look, when I saw Julia and Richard together, I was jealous. Not jealous like "Hey, they could be a couple and I'm not seeing anyone" jealous, but JEALOUS-jealous, you know what I mean?
40: wife	She's a WIFE-wife.
41: high	B:  It's not HIGH-high, but it ticked up slightly, and he does have a family history.
42: drink	Do you want coffee or a DRINK-drink?
43: talk	In fact I barely talked to him. Not TALK-talked.
44: rich	They are rich, of course; obscenely rich by the world's standards; but not RICH-rich, not New York City rich.
45: back	Actor:  Well, I wouldn't exactly call this "back". Not BACK-back, you know? Not like comeback back. Just a little independent thing.
46: egg	B:  I've had eggs in, like, cakes. Never had an EGG-egg. I was a very wilful child.
47: instant	Tim:   It's not like INSTANT-instant.
48: french	Police officer:   FRENCH-French?
49: cred	Who needs street-cred? I don't even have CRED-cred.
50: steal	Rayaan:   I didn't STEAL-steal it. I just didn't pay.
51: tonight's	Chair:   No, TONIGHT'S-tonight's minutes.
52: leaving	Ryan:   So, like, you're LEAVING-leaving? Leaving town?
53: bone	When you were a kid and you had a dog, did you ever try eating a bone? Not one of those BONE-bones, but a Milkbone?
54: orange	She was wearing an orange shirt. But she was blind, so I don't think she knew that it was ORANGE-orange.
55: split	Scott:   As in get out of here, or as in SPLIT-split?
56: bad	Is 37 grams [of saturated fat] good or bad? And even if we have an intuition that it's bad, we'd wonder if it was "BAD-bad" (like cigarettes) or "normal bad" (like a cookie or a milk shake).
57: girl	A:  No, I mean GIRL-girls
58: dead	You're not dead, are you? I mean, you're dead, but you're not DEAD-dead, because you're still here, aren't you?
59: thinking	B:  Like THINKING-thinking? That wasn't premeditated, I wasn't lying in wait. More like I was musing on the idea. Not, you know, dwelling. There were times I did dwell on you, about you, a little. But I wasn't seriously considering till the exact moment I did it. Or didn't do it.
60: party	Elena:   Not a PARTY-party. Just hanging out. We'll get a few people in here to help get rid of this ugly wallpaper.

62: promise	Michael:   I PROMISE-promise.
63: kid	Father:   Not KID-kids, men-kids.
64: guy	"I'm definitely reclaiming the feminine aspect of masculinity," [Gregory] Scratch explained. But he's also clearly equally keen to juice up the feminine cliches of domesticity with a jolt of testosterone. Those seductively macho paint jobs aren't meant purely as irony: "I'm probably as GUY-guy as a guy gets....I've got sideburns and I love muscle cars."
65: sorry	Dylan:   You're sorry or you're SORRY-sorry?
66: murray	A:   MURRAY-Murray!?
67: love	Dr. Joyce (on the TV):   Well, there are two kinds of love, Jerry. There's wellness love, which is good love, healthy love, LOVE-love.
68: adam	A:  No, like my Adam. Like ADAM-Adam.
69: white	Dressmaker:   Here's the skinny. We dressmakers have a very strict code, so I need to know, do you deserve to wear virginal white? Because if you don't, you'll have to wear an off-white, what we call a hussy white. So which will it be, WHITE-white?
70: marcus	They just call him psycho-Marcus because they're trying to distinguish between him and MARCUS-Marcus and normal-Marcus.
71: cow	Russell Banks, "Cow-Cow", short story in The Angel on the Roof, 2000.
72: salad	I'll make the tuna salad and you make the SALAD-salad.
73: gone	You think they're gone? Like GONE-gone?
74: out	B:  Yeah? You're OUT-out? [i.e., legally released from the mental institution]
75: guy	Robin:   Those GUY-guys, y'know? Those guys with skills?
76: doll	His girlfriend's a doll. Not like you're a doll. She's a DOLL-doll, like life-sized and plastic.
77: together	Chloe:   It's not like Philip and I are TOGETHER-together, it's -- we're just hanging out, seeing how things go.
78: handle	Xander:   Uh, no worries. I can handle the Oz Full Monty. I mean, not HANDLE-handle, like "hands to flesh" handle.
79: poker	Pacey:   Originally this was just POKER-poker, until I started kicking his ass. Then your friendly neighborhood co-worker decides to change the stakes on me, but I'm finished now, and, uh, we can just leave?
80: familiar	Kissinger:   That's OK. I'm familiar with these young ladies. Well, I'm not FAMILIAR-familiar... I know them.
81: crime	Jack:   No, whoa, it's not, like, CRIME-crime. It's crime -- well --
82: now	A:  Hey, NOW-now, man.
83: drink	Harold:   Oh, a DRINK-drink.
84: beach	Rafe:   It's a -- you know, the -- a BEACH-beach.
85: together	Blair:   I know that you guys aren't TOGETHER-together, but when I walked in here just now, it's obvious that you still care about him. I'm right to say that? I mean, you do still care about Sam, right?
86: rape	Rape? Raping you? Your father's brother RAPE-raped you?
87: couple	We're not one of those COUPLE-couples.
88: bad	Plus, there's a lot of really bad fiction out there -- not just wish-it-was-bad fiction that's actually really good, but BAD-bad fiction.
89: problem	A:  Problem. PROBLEM-problem.
90: friend	Julie:   Because I had boyfriends. Lots of them in high school. But for reasons too complicated and too big for this subway car, I, um, didn't have a lot of FRIEND-friends. Girlfriends.
91: home	Cassie:   I know that, for an ambassador's residence, but not for a HOME-home. I just really want a home, Richard. I want to be able to walk around in my bathrobe and not have to worry about it. I want the kids to be able to leave their toys all over the place, not worrying about some prime minister slipping on it.
92: funny	Lorelai:  He is funny, but I don't mean FUNNY-funny. I'm being philosophical.
93: french	Suspect:   FRENCH-French. From Belgium, originally.
94: dead	In those moments when you're not sure the undead are really DEAD-dead, don't get all stingy with your bullets. I mean, one more clean shot to the head, and this lady could have avoided becoming a human Happy Meal.
95: late	Grace:   No. Eat without me. I'm gonna be LATE-late.
96: hint	Michael:   It's funny. It's not a HINT-hint, but he has been calling me "pardner".
97: ugly	B:   Marianne-of-Gilligan's-Island ugly, not Cornelius-of-Planet-of-the-Apes ugly. TV ugly, not UGLY-ugly.
98: leave	Man:  No. When you LEAVE-leave. You know, when they take you.
99: help	Reverend Book:  I wish I could help. I mean, I don't wanna help -- not HELP-help, but -- not with the theiving, but -- I do feel awfully useless.
100: movie	It must be admitted that, for a MOVIE-movie, Infernal Affairs is subversively arty.
