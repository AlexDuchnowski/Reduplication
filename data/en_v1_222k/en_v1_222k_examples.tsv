62	back	Yeah I er, I went for a run.	You smell like you ran far.	Well I showered, I mean I guess I didn' t cool, I wanted to get back back down here and check on you, it was a Tour de Stad.	What?
63	very	W at that time was just starting out in the world as a business man.	Because he' s a guy who¡ ¯s always tried to emulate his father, uh, he decided to go into the oil business.	He founded an oil company, a drilling company, out of west Texas called Arbusto, which was very very good at drilling dry holes that nothing came out of.	But the question has always been where did this money come from?
64	very	It' s like training a dog; ya tell him to sit down or ya tell him to roll over at the same time, the dog doesn' t know what to do.	Well the American people are being treated like that.	It was really very very skillfully and, and ugly in what they did.	We must stop the terror.
65	very	That' s the case, for example with Microsoft.	So no wonder the support is so bad.	The benefits of Free Software were tremendous but the cost of supporting it internally uh, and made managers very very nervous and so the fundamental idea I had was if we can build a model that could deliver two to four times the support and uh, and uh, and hand holding capability that an internal engineer could provide.	And we could do it at 1/ 2 to 1/ 4 of the cost that would meet the test of whether or not people would actually buy.
66	city	Right and so we had maps there and we handed them off everybody who was coming.	Well, we actually met at a Denny' s That' s just outside the Foster City limits...	"Foster City city limits, which meant also just outside of Foster City Police jurisdiction, which meant any, any incidents that happened at the meeting point happened in the jurisdiction of San Mateo, and if they told us they get lost, we' d say, ""Fine, we are going to Foster city."	"Bye. """
67	very	If you don' t share, you get thrown in jail or killed.	In 1990, we got a visit from a director of an institute in uh, Moscow University, and actually I saw him in Helsinki just 2 weeks ago, but in any event, he came by, and Richard Stallman had suggested that he visit Cygnus, because he was interested in and understanding how the Free Software model... might apply to stimulating entrepreneurial innovation in Russia of all places, and we had been kind of secretive about our business plan, because you know, we were' nt really sure it' s gonna work, we didn' t want to look too stupid if it failed.	But I was very very open with him.	"The more I told him, the more he started to shake his head like this, and I finally said, you know, ""What' s wrong?"""
68	very	That' s the purest style and that' s the style that Joe and I had climbed Siula Grande.	It' s a very committing way of climbing, because you have no line of retreat.	If something goes wrong, it can be very very serious.	There' s no rescue, there' s no helicopter rescue and there' s no other people.
69	very	And to put an element of risk back into it takes us out of the humdrum.	In that sense, it makes you feel more alive.	I' ve never been that high before, and it' s very very strenuous to climb ice like that.	Not only is it technically difficult and unstable and frightening, but your heart is going like crazy because of the altitude.
70	very	And I' d be looking and trying to push the thing in, and using my teeth, and getting it round, and getting it round.	My hands were cold, my feet were...	I was very very cold.	It was a desperate position, made worse by the fact that that I had no idea what Joe was doing, or what position he was in.
71	very	I was pretty surprised to be alive.	The head torch beam just went down, and down, and down, and the darkness just ate it, just gone.	I felt very unnerved, very very vulnerable.	If I had landed less than 1m further to the right,
72	very	I started to go down the glacier on my own.	In this stage I was still certain that I was gonna die myself.	Crossing a glacier is very very dangerous on your own, because there are crevices in the ice, and the snow covers them.	Fortunately I managed to find a faint outline of our tracks, from when we walked in.
73	attack	I never felt angry at my dad.	My dad had nothing to do with this.	Someone knocks on the door and accuses you for a crime you didn' t commit you gotta attack attack your attackers and do what you can.	And that' s all it was.
74	fuck	Jesse' s gonna go to jail for the rest of his life.	Seth is gonna move west.	Fuck fuck.	I received a telephone call from jesse asking to see me and jesse told me that he wanted to plead guilty.
