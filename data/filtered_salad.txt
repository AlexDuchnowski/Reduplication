43: party	That's not DAD-Dad. That's party-party-bam-bam-nachos-for-everyone Dad.

47: date	Jack:   He's not my DATE-date. We're just going as friends. He calls it taking it to the next step towards self-acceptance and actualization. Whatever the hell that means.
48: date	Lucy:   A DATE-date? I'm jealous. I've never been on one.
49: date	Philip:   Oh, come on, chloe. I know we're a long way from all of that. Look, I just want to take you out, okay? Just hang out with you some night. Okay, it doesn't have to be at night. It doesn't have to be a DATE-date. We could just hang out some afternoon -- no big deal.
50: date	Jennifer:   No, I know. The last time, you were rescuing me, but this would be, like, a DATE-date.
51: dead	B:   You mean, like DEAD-dead?
52: dead	In those moments when you're not sure the undead are really DEAD-dead, don't get all stingy with your bullets. I mean, one more clean shot to the head, and this lady could have avoided becoming a human Happy Meal.
53: dead	In case I haven't been clear, I'm un-dead, not DEAD-dead. All those biological urges still apply.
54: dead	What's the difference between brain-dead and DEAD-dead?

61: doctor	Neighbour:  A DOCTOR-doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
62: dog	Take Charley, for example. He has always associated with the learned, the gentle, the literate, and the reasonable both in France and in America.

I don't know that he can read the thoughts of other dogs, but he can read mine.

93: friend	B:   Hmm. A FRIEND-friend friend or a FRIEND-friend?
94: friend	Julie:   Because I had boyfriends. Lots of them in high school. But for reasons too complicated and too big for this subway car, I, um, didn't have a lot of FRIEND-friends. Girlfriends.
95: friends	So I would say that the president and Mr. DeLay are friends, but not FRIENDS-friends, if you will.

116: guy	"I'm definitely reclaiming the feminine aspect of masculinity," [Gregory] Scratch explained. But he's also clearly equally keen to juice up the feminine cliches of domesticity with a jolt of testosterone. Those seductively macho paint jobs aren't meant purely as irony: "I'm probably as GUY-guy as a guy gets....I've got sideburns and I love muscle cars."
117: guy	Robin:   Those GUY-guys, y'know? Those guys with skills?
118: guys	Shelagh Rogers:   GUYS-guys.

122: hardest	Slim:  You know Finnegans Wake by James Joyce? My friend told me it's the hardest book in the English language. I mean, not the HARDEST-hardest, but the hardest one that you can actually read. I thought to myself, if I can get through it, I could probably read the rest.
123: hat	Should I wear a HAT-hat?

135: home	Cassie:   I know that, for an ambassador's residence, but not for a HOME-home. I just really want a home, Richard. I want to be able to walk around in my bathrobe and not have to worry about it. I want the kids to be able to leave their toys all over the place, not worrying about some prime minister slipping on it.
136: home	Livvie:   Why not? I mean, I only lived here a few years. It's not my HOME-home, and it's not really your home, either.

193: now	A:  Hey, NOW-now, man.

256: thing	"A THING-thing."
257: thing	"A THING-thing? You mean, really?"
258: thing	"Okay, it was. It was definitely a THING-thing."
259: thing	"Kanga had a THING-thing/kissing thing with Finn Murphy yesterday afternoon and we're only hearing about it now?" Cricket sounded outraged.
260: thing	"That's no excuse. You could have e-mailed us, at least," said Cricket. "You are shockingly out of line, young lady. THING-things with stud-muffins that no one else knows about? What is the world coming to?"
261: thing	"Wait!" I held up my hand. "It's only a real and true THING-thing if the kissing was good."
262: thinking	B:  Like THINKING-thinking? That wasn't premeditated, I wasn't lying in wait. More like I was musing on the idea. Not, you know, dwelling. There were times I did dwell on you, about you, a little. But I wasn't seriously considering till the exact moment I did it. Or didn't do it.
263: together	Yeah, 'cause they're all together. Like, TOGETHER-together. Um, the blonde girl, that's Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett, they're, like, a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal.
264: together	Julie:   We're not...we're not TOGETHER-together. We're just...we're hanging out. A lot.
265: together	Becky:   Supposedly, Susan thought she saw John and Gina together, you know, like together. But they weren't TOGETHER-together, they were just studying together. But Susan might break up anyway.
266: together	Not TOGETHER-together. Just "get the potion" together.
267: together	Nick:   TOGETHER-together?
268: together	Chloe:   It's not like Philip and I are TOGETHER-together, it's -- we're just hanging out, seeing how things go.
269: together	Blair:   I know that you guys aren't TOGETHER-together, but when I walked in here just now, it's obvious that you still care about him. I'm right to say that? I mean, you do still care about Sam, right?
270: tonight	B:  Oh! Okay, tonight. TONIGHT-tonight?
271: tonight's	Chair:   No, TONIGHT'S-tonight's minutes.
272: top	Joey:   The TOP-top?
273: tre	B:   Which Tre? TRE-Tre?
274: truth	Jen:   OK, the TRUTH-truth, or the what-Dawson-wants-to-hear truth?
275: truth	Rosanna:   TRUTH-truth, or convenient-in-the-moment truth?
276: tub	So what are you looking for? A Jacuzzi-type thing? Or a TUB-tub?
277: ugly	B:   Marianne-of-Gilligan's-Island ugly, not Cornelius-of-Planet-of-the-Apes ugly. TV ugly, not UGLY-ugly.
278: van	Look at all the yellow vans on the road. Not vans like ours [i.e., minivans], but VAN-vans.
279: war	Henry Blake:  Look, folks. You've picked a very busy spot. The war comes through here. Well, not war in your war-fighting sense, but rather in your aftermath sense, which is still WAR-war.
280: white	Dressmaker:   Here's the skinny. We dressmakers have a very strict code, so I need to know, do you deserve to wear virginal white? Because if you don't, you'll have to wear an off-white, what we call a hussy white. So which will it be, WHITE-white?
281: wife	She's a WIFE-wife.
282: woody	Oh, WOODY-Woody. Oh well, listeners, this is an old friend of mine from back in Boston. Well, how you doin' there, you old cowpoke?
283: work	Wednesday is my WORK-work day.
284: work	Paige:   Well, between witch work and WORK-work, I just don't have any time any more.
285: work	Marina:   No, I mean, I don't mind, like, giving you a hand if you need one. I mean, it could be different from the whole punishment thing. You know, like actual WORK-work.
286: wrong	Grams:   Oh, well, I--I don't mean WRONG-wrong, it's just that we've always had... girls.
