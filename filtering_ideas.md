# Filtering Ideas
- Filtering out proper nouns & names (automatically using parsers)
- Filtering out words shorter than 3 letters (can increase this threshold)
- Only looking at reduplication of single words/lexems
- Filter by part of speech and only keep words whose POS we're interested in (automated with spacy/NLTK)
- Remove triplication (or more than two instances in a row)
- If the same example shows up at least three times in a row (in the table), remove it (probably a song/chant)
- Keeping casing in mind
- Reducing repeated lines
- Specific items:
    - Onomatopoeia
    - Greek Letters
    - "That"
    - "There"
    - "like like"
